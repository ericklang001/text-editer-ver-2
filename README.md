the text editer was build with python and python's library tkinter,
it supports three edit modes: label-text edit, notebook edit, free-edit
and I have set four default theme to be choose, if you want you add your new thme style, just add configs in file:
  theme.py, but before you add you theme fecture, firstly realize what does each configs means.
