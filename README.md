The text editer was build with python and python's library tkinter,
it supports three edit modes: label-text edit, notebook edit, free-edit
and I have set four default themes to be chosed, if you want to add your new theme style, just add configs in file:
theme.py, but before you add you theme fecture, firstly realize what does each configs means.
